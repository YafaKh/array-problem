It is year 2022. As you can see it has many twos, but what makes is more special is that it is the second
year for the ACPC Teens. The ACPC clever teens are getting more and more excited about competiting
and learning new things. And this year, Bayan, the ACPC Teens director, has so many surprises up in
her sleeve for the contest.
To keep the excited clever teen busy so that Bayan can focus on her preparations, she gave them the
following problem to solve.
Given an array A of N integers, Bayan defined a function G(A) as the sum of the product of each
element and its index. More formally G(A) =
PN
i=1(i × A[i]). For example, if A = [2,6,3,7], then G(A) =
(2 × 1) + (6 × 2) + (3 × 3) + (7 × 4) = 51. Notice that the array starts with index 1.
Also she defines a swap as choosing two indices i and j and replacing Aj with Ai and vice versa.
Bayan then asks the teens, what is the maximum value of G(A) after performing at most one swap?
One of your students told you about the problem and asked for help. You read the problem and liked it
and decided to solve it yourself.
Input
The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.
The first line in each test case consists of a single integer N (2 ≤ n ≤ 5000), the number of elements in
the array.
The second line contains N integers, the elements of the array (−109 ≤ Ai ≤ 109
).
Output
For each test case, print one line containing a single integer which is the maximum value of G(A) after at
most one swap.
